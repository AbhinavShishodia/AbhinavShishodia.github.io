            <h2>The Start</h2>
            <p>My journey in AUI started in mid novemeber 2020,I was suffering on a website named DTI(Dead Toons India) and i completed 2 seasons of Beyblade Burst and I wanted to watch more,So i joined the server link they provided and there i met a member named Enrique popularly known as Kazuto,He helped me and gave me the link of beyblade burst's other seasons and after completing it i gone to chat in that server, When i was introducing myself, I met a person named Param Gyani Baba, I wanted to become friends with him and to chat with him i accidentaly mass pinged him(I didn't knew what is mass ping at that time)and hence got banned but i made an alt and rejoined, That's it for the start of my journey, I will continue it after members introduction, SO let me introduce you all to them...</p>

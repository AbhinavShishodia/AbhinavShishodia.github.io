<p>Yo!! guys,So today I am going to tell you about my adventure in AUI(ANIME UNIVERSE INDIA), Firstly let me tell you about AUI. So basically AUI is one of the <strike>biggest</strike>,craziest,friendly and awesome discord server of India.So my journey there started in mid November 2020, I was watching Beyblade burst on a website named DTI and there were only 2 seasons of beyblade burst on that website and i wanted to watch more, Then i accidentally scrolled down and saw a message "Join our discord supoort server" and I joined it, after joining it, I met a very helpful person there named Enrique popularly known as Kazuto, He gave me the link of Beyblade burst s3 and i was very happy and i gone back to watch it.After completing s3,I opened discord to chat there and a member named <b>Param Gyaani Baba</b> started chatting with me,I wanted to become his friend so I accidentally mass pinged him(i didn't knew what was mass ping at that time) and he reported me for that and someone banned me and I became sad then i made an alt and joined it again,Here I am finished with how I started my journey...Now let me introduce you to our all main characters/members.</p>

        <p>
          As i mentioned earlier that i am gonna introduce you all to our Admins and So,I am introducing you to them,So as you know that HIKKI was the one to establish first and best admin panel
          ever of AUI and after almost 4 years AUI is still alive and now is a reknown server and our current admin panel is not as good as the one created by HIKKI but this admin panel is made of 2 members,First one is ICY and 2nd is Spidey and our ex admin Dora is always there to help spidey,You must be confused that ICY is owner so why i am mentioning him in Admins,Actually ICY's alt is the owner and the original account of ICY is admin,Now let me introduce you
          all to them in a more explaining way...I will not introduce ICY here because i introduced him as owner before,I wil introduce you to our ex-admin and the best admin Dora here....

    <h2>Spidey</h2>
    <p>
Spidey is the current and most active admin of AUI and under his control <strike>we have some Talented MODS</strike>,Spidey is also one of the oldest members and ig..in 2019 Dora said that Spidey is the future of AUI and see it's true now,Dora sure is a god.
Spidey is from one of the most favourite Admins of AUI after Dora,Well we all know Dora will always remain at top because we all admire him,One of the secrets about Spidey is that he is a big simp,He was caught asking for photos of Kingslayer's GF from him in DMs
and He is a big simp of Kami Sama(The only active girl of AUI) and I got info from my sources that he watches hentai while putting his status as AFK.Spidey is also a programmer and He had created some awesome bots which include The torrent bot(it is the only one of its type on whole discord and is also verified) and He also created another bot named

    <h2>Dora</h2>
    <p>
        Dora is the best admin of AUI ever,He is one of the first members of AUI and He is also one of the closest friend of ICY and probably the only person who knows ICY's real name,Dora's server management and event management skills are awesome,H eis one of the best event host of AUI and also the crush of many members of AUI but our Kazuto bro is the only one who got love of Dora ;-;(Btw Dora is the best trap )
Now let me tell you "How ICY and Dora met" So almost 3 years ago Dora met a guy talking about Indian Cartoons and Animes and his opinions about it,Dora was really impressed by that guy and after some time Dora joined AUI and there was a guy(ICY) discussing about anime and cartoon stuff,So Dora copy pasted the things that person she met before said and when he did that,ICY SAID "Dude these are the things i once said" and Dora was surprised,Feels like destiny,Doesn't it?

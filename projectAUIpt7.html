    <p>
      Rameez is one of the first and biggest anime ka choda in AUI,
      He watches a lot of anime and also the
      uncrowned king of anime events which are held
      in AUI and in every event all participants raise a tag <b>#BanRameez</b> 
      because he annoys everyone due to his anime ke chodo wali skills,
      some months ago he was the king of anime ke chodo but a guy stole his title,
      I will introduce you to him on this same webpage...

       Noyr-san is the guy who stole Rameez's title of the king of Anime ke 
       chodo,He is not new in AUI and nor he is old but he got his
       own reputation as an anime ka choda in AUI,He is a damn pro 
       not just in the case of anime but also in mangas,If
       he founds an anime interesting,He just starts its manga for example 
       "Kaguya-Sama Love is War" and there are plenty of others,In AUI if u want
       a suggestion about any type of anime you can ask out anime ke chodes.

      So we are here at the last webpage of our introduction phase guys,It is
      sad that slowly slowly our OGs of AUI are going offline and it is very
      painful that the members who made AUI the server in which we all became
      friends and chatted and shared our emotions and stories is slowly going
      far from our OGs's life and this website was a small gift from me as a
      memoria of the moments they spent and shared here,I will continue
      updating this website in future and i look forward to my dream of
      becoming a developer by doing these small small tasks and improving my
      skills,Thank you for giving us a great server like AUI,I will treasure
      the memories of AUI for my whole life and i think we all will...
      Ik there were supposed to be two more pages but i removed them for now
      as i will add them in future,I will update you all,So u can visit if u want...

      Thanks... and umeed h OGs ise padhke ke emotional ho jaaye and mujhe boht saare AUI gems dede,Hehe.ss

      Rameez is one of the first and biggest anime ka choda in AUI,
      He watches a lot of anime and also the
      uncrowned king of anime events which are held
      in AUI and in every event all participants raise a tag <b>#BanRameez</b> 
      because he annoys everyone due to his anime ke chodo wali skills,
      some months ago he was the king of anime ke chodo but a guy stole his title,
      I will introduce you to him on this same webpage...

       Noyr-san is the guy who stole Rameez's title of the king of Anime ke 
       chodo,He is not new in AUI and nor he is old but he got his
       own reputation as an anime ka choda in AUI,He is a damn pro 
       not just in the case of anime but also in mangas,If
       he founds an anime interesting,He just starts its manga for example 
       "Kaguya-Sama Love is War" and there are plenty of others,In AUI if u want
       a suggestion about any type of anime you can ask out anime ke chodes.

            <p>
                You all know that this world is full of gaymers,You can find a gamer at any place and luckily in AUI almost all active members 
                are gaymers but some of them hold special skills and as a writer of this website its my duty to introduce you all to them,They are not just gaymers but they also have some other funny things about them rather than just being a gamer.
                Now let me introduce you all to them...

        <h2>Venky Bro</h2>
        <p>
            Venky bro aka Bhaadu tits is one of the oldest members of AUI and is also a good friend of Amit bro aka PikaBitch and He is said to be the wisest person in AUI by some MODs but he never claimed that,
            He is good at games like GTA-V and also plays Valorandi but there is a problem and it is that the laptop of venky bro is of garam hips(it overheats a lot) and because of that He can't play High end games rather than gayming Venky bro taught some
            things to the  OGs of AUI,He gave all of them a habit of saying "bsdk","hn" and "suar" and last but not least He have a habit of chewing paan in his words
            He calls stomach(payt) as pent :Kek: and He he puts "n" in any word he wants(<b>sources to ye bhi kehte h ki "Cheems The Doge" ke teacher ye hi h cos cheems ko bhi "m" ghusane ki aadat h words me)</b>

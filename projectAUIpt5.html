     <p>
	      The Wallpaper god popularly known as HURI-CHAN or Huri Bro is a very old member of AUI, I don't know when he joined AUI but many members told me that he is one of the oldest members of AUI,Now let me tell you "Why we call him the Wallpaper God?" He got this title/nickname because he is the one who fulfill the needs of wallpapers for AUI members and he also posts NSFW stuff in AUI's NSFW channel and personally I respect him a lot beacuse of his kind behavior towards me but sometimes I annoy him so He also gets angry(afterall he is also a human)...Now imma tell you about some special and interesting things about him...
    </p>
<ul>
	<li>He have the best Wallpapers and NSFW stuff and he is a regular poster of these in AUI.
	<li>He knows a lot about our Indian Culture and History and sometimes if there is mood we all discuss about it to.
	<li>Unlike most of the other teenagers who think not believing in god is cool, He have faith in a divine power,Ik some of you will think it is weird but it is good.

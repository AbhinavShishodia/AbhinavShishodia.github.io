          <b>"Aynul"</b> this name comes first in every old member of and some
          new to when someone asks who is/was the biggest chutiya in AUI (meri
          alag baat h,ik mai bhi chutiya hu but aynul se kam) and He had almost
          no deep knowledge about space but still bande ko raw gyaan chodna tha,
          He loved to flex but his flexes were roasted by some wise people of
          AUI but still jo bhi ho banda accha tha.

          Aynul was only a chutiya but MasterZack was a human of another
          species,He flexed about his Coding skills but ended up getting
          roasted. He was the winner of the Aynul award 2020(The chutiya award),
          He wasn't only chutiya but he was also cringe and at last due to this
          thing,He became an inspiration of Chutiyas for getting banned some
          examples are Asmit sir(The person who hacked NASA with HTML) and Semen
          Ka Choda(The guy who came late night in AUI and boht gyaan choda
          Mr.Baiting ke baare me and ended up getting banned).
